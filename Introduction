  The problem that is to be solved is to determine the locations, times of day, and weather conditions that elicit the most severe car accidents in Seattle, so that they may be prevented in the future. The issue of automobile accident severity would be particularly useful to the Seattle Police Department as well as the Department of Public Works, and as such, they would be the audience for this problem. In determining which areas and times of day correspond with the most severe accidents, they would have it in their power to mitigate the circumstances that contribute to these accidents, namely, issuing more police officers in that area, improving roads, installing streetlights and relevant road signs, etc. The ultimate goal would be to reduce the number of accidents in these areas over a given period of time, or at least reduce their average severity, and in turn reduce the fatality rate associated with these accidents.
