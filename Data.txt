The data to be used is a CSV file sourced from the Seattle Police Department. It spans roughly 16 years and includes data on various recorded motor vehicle accidents. The data includes features such as accident severity, road condition, weather condition, light conditions, time of day, location, and accident descriptions. Using the data, it is possible to determine which features contribute most to accident severity, as well as build a predictive model. For example, if we find that light conditions, namely low-light circumstances, contribute most to accident severity in certain locations, the city of Seattle may take it upon itself to install streetlights or road signs at those locations. Similarly, through a predictive model, one will be able to input certain conditions regarding the driving conditions, time, and location, and receive a severity estimate for an accident that may occur.
